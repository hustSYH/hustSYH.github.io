欢迎来到我的主页！我是孙依晗，目前我在华中科技大学攻读硕士学位，导师为[沈卫明院士](http://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1143/1385.htm)。此前，我在中南大学取得了学士学位（2024），并有幸获得了湖南省优秀毕业生奖。展望未来，我很期望能在即将到来的2027年秋季攻读博士学位。

Welcome to my homepage! I am Yihan Sun(孙依晗). Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Shen Weiming](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Central South University in 2024 and was fortunate to receive the Excellent Graduate Award of Hunan Province. Looking ahead, I am excited to pursue a doctoral degree in the upcoming fall of 2027.

我的研究方向围绕**工业视觉检测**展开，涉及图像与点云的机器人采集、异常检测等，硕士期间后续的研究重点为构建**高性能的点云异常检测方法**。如果对我的研究感兴趣，随时可以联系我，我非常乐意与您进行交流！


My research focuses on **industrial visual inspection**, covering areas such as robotic acquisition of images and point clouds, anomaly detection, etc. The subsequent research focus during my master's studies will be on developing **high-performance point cloud anomaly detection methods**. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me at any time, and I will be happy to communicate with you!

😊😊😊
